# Wumpus-Hunt
Hunt the Wumpus was an early computer game. The basic goal of the game is to kill a wumpus in a cave without entering the chamber the wumpus is in, using your senses to detect when it is close by. Along the way you can fall into pits, be picked up by bats, and discover objects such as arrows and treasure.
